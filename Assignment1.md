# CST8914 Assignment 1 - Real-Time Applications with REST, GraphQL & WebSockets
By Samuel Baumann & Mohit Singh Panwar

Scenario: Real-time chat application use case, with a focus on social platforms

This document will outline the major considerations for how chat applications have advanced with modern technologies to handle real-time data management and communication.

## REST & GraphQL

For social media chat applications, having two or more devices connected and talking to each other in real-time is a self-evident requirement - the whole point
of a live chat is that it's live! To accomplish this, developers can choose between having their endpoints communicate with each other via REST, a scaleable, reliable
and widely adopted API that fetches data in large round trips, or GraphQL, a more complex but surgical way to fetch a select slice of information from an endpoint.

Let's start by taking a look at a typical RESTful API for a chat application. In particular, we can look at how an app would GET, POST, PUT or DELETE information from a
server. As its name implies, the GET method retrieves data from a backend. It is read-only, and does not modify the data in any way. For example:

```
{
    Does Markdown Support Code Blocks
}
```

## WebSockets
